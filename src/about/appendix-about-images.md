# Introduction

In the digital battlefield, images serve as tactical assets, reinforcing news content with visuals that immerse the reader in the Supreme Commander universe. As part of this operation, all images must adhere to strict specifications to ensure consistency, accessibility, and thematic integrity.

# Requirements

## Technical Requirements

- Resolution: 960x540 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio for optimal display).
- Encoding: PNG format for lossless quality.
- Storage Location: Place all images in `src/assets/images/<year>/<image-name>.png`, ensuring proper organization by year.
- Responsive Optimization: The framework automatically generates responsive versions, so no manual resizing is necessary.

## Content Guidelines

- No Embedded Text: Text within the image is not readable by screen readers. Any necessary text should be introduced via HTML and front matter.
- Thematic Relevance: Every image must feature a Supreme Commander-related subject, such as units, maps, or other elements from the universe.
- Visual Integrity: Avoid compression artifacts or low-quality renders that compromise the visual experience.

## Legal Considerations

- Copyright-Free: Only images with no copyright restrictions are permitted.
- AI-Generated Images: Allowed, provided they align with thematic relevance and quality expectations.
